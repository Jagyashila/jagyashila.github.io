# About

"I can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then."-Alice, in Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Lewis Caroll.

Yet, I am Karma, the results of past actions.

We all are evolving through time, guided by the blind watchmaker, adapting to everyday stimulus and finding our best move forward. However there is one true essence in all of us. For me that's largely the spirit of inquisition. I look into human health using multi-omics approaches, leveraging bioinformatic tools and statistical models. I also collaborate (and look forward to it) with cross-disciplinary scientists, which keeps me intellectually engaged.

But I'm not just a scientist in a lab coat; I'm an aspiring storyteller, a translator of the language of life. I am intrigued by nature's intricate designs.

When I am not researching, I am probably either being a potato, or swimming, karate-ing, running, cooking, or watching movies from around the world. I am also a wildlife enthusiast, and love taking pictures!
